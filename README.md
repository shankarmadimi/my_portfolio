My React portfolio showcases a dynamic interface enhanced with GSAP for fluid animations and smooth transitions between pages. To improve the overall user experience, I added intuitive hover effects that respond to user actions. The site also features a functional map powered by React Leaflet, contributing both interactive value and visual interest. Furthermore, I integrated Email.js with the contact form, enabling users to send messages directly without leaving the website.
